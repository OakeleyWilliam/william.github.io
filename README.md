Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because I find blackjack really interesting. I think that showing how it works in the lab will help people understand how to play it. I also liked the way the lab was set up.
Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was easy to do. As the first lab the instructions were clear and it was fun to do. It made getting the basics a little easier to understand.
Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites because I didn’t know what the conversion rate of volume was. This lab helped me understand the conversion rate of volume. I also liked that the lab wasn’t as hard as some of the other labs.
