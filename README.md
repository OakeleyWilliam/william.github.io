### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites because I find blackjack really
    interesting. I think that showing how it works in the lab will help
    people understand how to play it. I also liked the way the lab was set up.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorites because it was easy to do. As the
    first lab the instructions were clear and it was fun to do. It made
    getting the basics a little easier to understand.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorites because I didn’t know what the
    conversion rate of volume was. This lab helped me understand the
    conversion rate of volume. I also liked that the lab wasn’t as hard as
    some of the other labs.
